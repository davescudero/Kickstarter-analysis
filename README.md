# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Challenge 1 Kickstarter analysis: Perform a data analysis to Kickstarter to uncover trends
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help the client Louise to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- The month that had the most outcomes based on Launch Date was May. However, May, June and July had roughly the same number of successful outocomes. So we can imply that the best season to Launch any play is the second quarter of the year. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart.

- The month with the worst outcomes based on Launch Date was October, beside having the roughly the same number of failed outcomes than May (the month with the best outcomes), the percentage of successful plays was very different.
 
- We can conclude that after the best launching season (second quarter of the year), theres a peak in failed plays, people prefer going to the theater on final spring and summer, rather than the final part of the year

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Outcomes based on plays are really simple, the best outcomes were the ones with the lower goals (less than $1000), however theres a range where the percentage failed is lower than the majority of the goal outcomes and not being the lower one: $35,000-$40,000, which is a better goal, considering the outcomes of the different ranges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- One of the greatest challenges of this project was for me to work wtih a different Excel language, cause i had to translate every Formula
- One of the greatest difficulties i found by doing this analysis was the fundraising money for each of the project, and the littles success of the play with bigger goals 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1- The best Launch Date season is May-July, being May the one with the best outcome by far.
  2-There´s a big drop in positive outcomes finishing the best season, so there´s no linear behavior, but just one good outcomes peak
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - The more realistic goals you have regard the final Goal, the better results you will have, being the best goal range 35000-40000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - The different categories and subcategories shown in the data base, which makes a more complicated analysis
  - The limitations on the information based on the type of plays shown
 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - We can create an analysis of the percentage of budget, pledged and goal, and the relationship between them
  - An analysis based on staff pick and spotlight, so we can relate publicity with the final outcomes
